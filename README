This is a skeleton repo meant as a starting point when building packages. A
Makefile has been added for convenient installation/uninstallation. The
relevant commands are the following:

    * `make` -- install the package
    * `make uninstall` -- uninstall the package
    * `make reinstall` -- uninstall and reinstall the package
    * `make clean` -- remove generated temporary files
    * `make code-analysis` -- run flake8 and pylint on repository
