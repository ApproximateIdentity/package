README
------

This is a skeleton repo meant as a starting point when building packages. It is
both a skeleton for a basic python package involving a server. The server can
be installed the normal way using setuptools and it can also be built as a
debian package.


Debian Package Build Requirements
---------------------------------

To build the debian package, it is easiest if you have python installed as your
own user (as opposed to root). The easiest way to do this is probably to
install the Continuum Anaconda python distribution. You also need the following
debian/Ubuntu packages installed:

    * dh-virtualenv
    * python-stdeb

Additionaly, you need the following python package (installable through pip):

    * make-deb


Makefile
--------

The relevant commands for building the python package are the following:

    * `make install` -- install the package
    * `make uninstall` -- uninstall the package
    * `make reinstall` -- uninstall and reinstall the package
    * `make clean` -- remove generated temporary files
    * `make code-analysis` -- run flake8 and pylint on repository (requires
                              flake8 and pylint to be installed!)

The relevant commands for building the debian package are the following:

    * `make clean-debian` -- clean files generated for debian package
    * `make debian-package` -- build the debian package
    * `make install-debian` -- install the debian package
    * `make uninstall-debian` -- uninstall the debian package

In either case, things worked correctly if the following executes correctly at
the command-line:

    $ start_server

_Note_: Remember to add `/usr/share/python/package/bin/` to your path as that
is where the debian binaries will be installed.
