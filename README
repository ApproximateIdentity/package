This is a skeleton repo meant as a starting point when building packages. It is
both a skeleton for a basic python package involving a server as well as for a
debian package using the python packages `dh-virtualenv` and `make-deb`.
A Makefile has been added for convenient installation/uninstallation.

The relevant commands for building the python package are the following:

    * `make install` -- install the package
    * `make uninstall` -- uninstall the package
    * `make reinstall` -- uninstall and reinstall the package
    * `make clean` -- remove generated temporary files
    * `make code-analysis` -- run flake8 and pylint on repository (requires
                              flake8 and pylint to be installed!)

The relevant commands for building the debian package are the following:

    * `make clean-debian` -- clean files generated for debian package
    * `make debian-package` -- build the debian package
    * `make install-debian` -- install the debian package
    * `make uninstall-debian` -- uninstall the debian package

In either case, things worked correctly if the following executes correctly at
the command-line:

    $ start_server
